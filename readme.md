# Project - M1 GENIOMHE 2024/25: 

_Introduction on the species, structural genomics and goal of this project, then discuss potential issues that might arise due to complexity. Proceed by summarizing the desired workflow highlighting the criteria demanded by the instructor to be fulfilled_

## Exploration

### Sequence properties

Checking GC content in this region to have an idea about potential gene desnitites. For that we run the script:  

```bash
python src/GCcontent.py data/region8.fasta
```
The GC content of the DNA sequence is 48%.

## Region localization

Want to localize this region by mapping agaisnt the reference sequence of _Triticum aestivum_ (available on RefSeq at [GCF_018294505.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_018294505.1/))

## Validation

### BLAST

To validate the predicted genes, we will start of by blasting against the proteome of _Triticum aestivum_ available on UniProt. We retrieved the list of proteins from the supplementary material of an International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) published in _Science_[^5] aiming to provide an annotated reference sequence of the _Triticum aestivum_ genome. The article is available [here](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30115783). We will access all the proteins sequences (including isoforms) using an api call to the UniProt database.

```bash
curl https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/stream?compressed=true&format=fasta&query=%28%28lit_pubmed%3A30115783%29%29 > data/proteins.fasta.gz
gunzip data/proteins.fasta.gz
```
```bash
cat data/proteins.fasta | grep '>' | wc -l 
130283
```
There is a total of 130283 proteins in the file. We will now perform a BLAST search against this database to see if our predicted genes are similar to any of the known annotated proteins of _Triticum aestivum_. It'll be a tblastn search, as we are looking for protein sequences that are similar to our DNA sequence (which increases the sensitivity of the search, as it takes into account the codon degenracy). 

```bash
# --creating the local database
makeblastdb -in data/proteins.fasta -dbtype prot -out data/database/Triticum_aestivum_proteins_uniprot
# --running the blast search  
tblastn -query data/region8.fasta -db data/database/Triticum_aestivum_proteins_uniprot -out output/blast/ region8_vs_Triticum_aestivum_proteins_uniprot.blast -outfmt 7
```



### Transcriptome 

The [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) comprises a large collection of sequencing data from raw sequences to assembly to functionally annotated ones. While looking for [transcriptome studies for _Triticum aestivum_](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/Taxon:4565) we find several projects (Total= 22, in this table[^1]) 



_TSA stands for Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly_

One of them is published by [Xiao et al. (2013) in BMC Genomics](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-197) [REF1]. They have performed short read RNA-seq using Illumina Hi-Seq tech, and deposited the project's raw reads on the SRA database, project [`SRX212270`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRX212270). We will use this as trial to explore how we can validate using Whole Transcriptomes before optimizing our choice. 

#### Trial 1: blasting against transcriptome 

As a first attempt, due to the high memory requirement (_e.g.,_ one of them is 15GB of reads), we have tried performing BLAST on ncbi's server against this whole transcriptome in [^2], with default parameters (can perform it [here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&BLAST_PROGRAMS=megaBlast&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&BLAST_SPEC=SRA&DB_GROUP=Exp&NUM_ORG=1&EQ_MENU=SRX212270) by just adding the [region8 fasta file](./data/region8.fasta)). The default search gave no significant results, we will try to relax the paramters (BLOSUM45 and lowering penalties, accepting lower thresholds...)



#### Trial 2: downloading the WTS data

We will try downloading the reads of [^2] to see how to manipulate such a large file. Since it surpasses the threshold to download a file from SRA webserver (which is 5GB), we will download it using [`sra-toolkit`]().  
While running out of time and memory, we will try doing that using Galaxy[^3][^4].

#### Trial 3: Analysis

Working on galaxy, first retrieve the SRA accession number from the project, tools > Get data > EBI SRA, copy the accession number and get the fastq in galaxy. After loading them (paired end so 2 fastq) > fastq groomer, to make sure the fastq format fits Galaxy's requirement and make it run. Meanwhile > FastQC to make sure the quality of the transcriptome is good or whether it's better to take another set of reads.

We will try now mapping: using Tophat2, we will map the reads to the reference genome of _Triticum aestivum_ (available on ENSEMBL) to see how many reads are mapped and how many are not. We have taken the reference genome using 

#### Trial 4: visualization

_trying to perform RNA-seq aln and viz using IGV_
